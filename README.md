# saarthi-v2-main

This repository contains the Saarthi project with a client (`ims`) and a Node server (`server`).

## Quick start

From the repository root:

1. Install dependencies (already run in this session):

```
cd ims
npm install
cd ../server
npm install
```

2. Run the server and client (two terminals):

Terminal A (server):

```
cd server
npm start
```

Terminal B (client):

```
cd ims
npm run dev
```

3. Open the client Vite URL shown in the terminal (typically `http://localhost:5173`).

## Notes
- This repo includes `ims` (React + Vite) and `server` (Express).
- Create a GitHub repo and push the initial commit if you want a remote — I can do that for you if you grant permission.
